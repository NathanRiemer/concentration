# TO DO:

## Appearance:
-  [] Image files
  -  [] Resize files
  -  [] Optimize for squareness
-  [] Improve general appearance
  -  [] Borders
  -  [] Coloring
  -  [] Size
  -  [] Position
  -  [] Font
  -  [] Layout
-  [] Animation?

## Content
-  [] Add landing page (probably just expand instructions)

## Behavior
-  [] Display high scores in order of number of pairs?
-  [] Could the number of pairs available depend on the category input? 

## Backstage Code improvements
-  [] Wrap pertinent code in document ready function

## To ask Sung
-  [] Could I make a function that automatically grabbed all the files in a directory (based on input from the user) and put those files / their names in an array? 
-  [] If not, how do I include other files (for the image array)?
-  [] Passing the calling object using this to another class' method -- kosher? (see Game.prototype.startTimer for an example)
-  [] Thoughts about the program's complexity? I did my best to separate out objects and methods in a way that makes sense. The code has gotten long-ish, but I think that's okay considering all the functionality. 
-  [] Copyright issue?
